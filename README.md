# Maps

Maps is a Veronoi diagram visualization of restaurant ratings using machine learning and the Yelp academic dataset. In this visualization, Berkeley is segmented into regions, where each region is shaded by the predicted rating of the closest restaurant (yellow is 5 stars, blue is 1 star). 

In the visualization, each dot represents a restaurant. The color of the dot is determined by its location. For example, downtown restaurants are colored green. The generated map will also color the user's preferred regions yellow.
